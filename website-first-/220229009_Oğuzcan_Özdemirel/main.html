            <p> You see Madara, one of the founders of the Konoha village, and Itachi, a member of the same village several generations later.
             Known as the two most powerful members of the Uchiha clan, Uchiha Itachi and Uchiha Madara specialized in many types of jutsu, especially genjutsu.
             Both of them have done anything for their own purposes. 
             Itachi was just a brother who wanted to protect his sibling.
             In this pursuit, he faced a lot of exclusion and loneliness.
             Madara, on the other hand, was a powerful shinobi who wanted to rule the world in his own way. He took countless lives in pursuit of this goal and ultimately lost his own life.
             Both of them did their best to achieve their dreams, but the results were not always what they wanted.
             If you want to learn more about these two powerful shinobi, choose one.
